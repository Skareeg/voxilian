=Project Wiki Home=

*Hello,* and welcome to the Voxilian Wiki. I no nothing about keeping up a wiki myself, so here it goes.

All documentation of code for this project, specifically orienting around the classes and structures used within it, will be found right here for you all to read. If I don't have something listed, let me know and I will maybe update it soon.

For starters, this game is based around the idea of Minecraft, so credit goes to Mojang. Head on over to https://minecraft.net/ to see for yourself. The idea behind this is to create a game almost exactly like minecraft, just without all of the blockiness that goes with it.

That's it for now.
