=Voxilian Indev 1.0.0=

This is the earliest stable build of voxilian. It will require the Visual Studio C++ Runtime Environment to run.

It literally has nothing in it but a triangle. A plain. White. Triangle. Hey, at least you can fly right?

The majority of this build occurs in the background, however. This was the first build that contained multiple types of voxels, due to the voxels ability to hold a mesh, rather than just being a cube or just being geometry. I had an issue with to C++ header files including each other. A rookie problem with a rookie solution. I am still learning C++ to this day. I forward declared the VoxelChunk class within Voxel.h, and then include VoxelChunk.h in Voxel.cpp in order to declare its content.

I don't really need a picture here to explain the content of this build. It's a triangle.
